# (Un)Lock Pdf
 Simple tool to lock and unlock pdf files for Windows 10-11 (Sub-context menu for 11)
 
 After downloading the latest release you can install the software. To use the program, simply right-click any .pdf file or folder containing .pdf files and select whether you would like to lock or unlock the pdf(s). Enter the password and you're good to go!
 
 Feel free to fork or do anything you'd like with this, it's a very rudimentary software and the github (not release) is only containing the python program that handles the pdf editing, not the c# installer program which installs an updater and the context menu.
